# MENACE

* THE terminal LLM tool for all your needs

## Run instructions

* Currently planning  on adding this to the npm registry

### For local download:

* cd into the `menace-cli` directory
* `npm run build` - to build into the `bin` directory
* `npm i -g .` - installs package globally
* `menace` - run in any directory, and you can interact with the AI agent


## Codebase Explanation

* Note that since Bubble Tea and Lipgloss are such obscure TUI frameworks, I am possibly placing excessive comments on my code
