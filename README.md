# Menace CLI

This README was generated by Menace
Menace CLI is a cross-platform, terminal-based intelligent assistant built with Go and Node.js.  It uses OpenAI’s API under the hood and provides an interactive TUI (text user interface) powered by [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for the UI and [LangChainGo](https://github.com/tmc/langchaingo). Menace can suggest shell commands, help navigate code, read and write code, and generally make your terminal sessions more productive.

## Features

- Cross-platform binaries for Windows, macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), and Linux
- Interactive TUI with mouse support
- Context-aware LLM agent backed by OpenAI and Anthropic
- Easy install/build via npm scripts or manual Go build
- Lightweight Node wrapper (`menace`) that spawns the correct Go binary

## Prerequisites

- Go (1.18+ recommended)
- Node.js (v14+) and npm

## Installation

### 1 From npm (recommended and coming soon!)

```bash
npm install --global menace-cli
```

### 2 From source

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/menace-cli.git
   cd menace-cli
   ```
2. Set your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   ```
3. Build all the platform binaries (into `./bin`):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Link the CLI locally:
   ```bash
   npm link
   ```

## Usage

```bash
menace
```

## Build Scripts

- `npm run build`  Builds Go binaries for all supported OS/architectures into `./bin`.
- `npm run build-windows`  Builds only the Windows executable.
- `npm run build-mac`  Builds only the macOS executables (Intel & ARM).

## Configuration

Menace uses your OpenAI API key; set it in the environment:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-…"
```

On Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-…"
```
